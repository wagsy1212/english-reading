It was because Johnny gave her pink roses when she was accepted to dental school. Robin would cry and talk about Johnny to her friends. They felt sorry for her. How could she think about one person so much? Robin said she still had hope that they would get back together. Her friends said that she needed to stop thinking that.

    "content": "Since George's daughter Brenda was born, he has videotaped important moments in her life. He has videotapes of Brenda's first walk, talk, day at school and more. Brenda was about to graduate from college. George was definitely recording her graduation. He was even throwing her a surprise graduation party, where he planned on showing the videotapes. After Brenda's graduation, George and his wife told her they had to go back home because they forgot cash. When Brenda opened the door, the guests shouted, \"Surprise!\" Brenda was so shocked. She was not expecting this. There were decorations everywhere and pictures of her posted on the wall. Her parents also got Brenda her favorite food, spaghetti. They got her favorite type of cake, too. George started playing the tapes. The first one he played was the one of her crawling to the kitchen. The last one George wanted to play was the one of Brenda opening her acceptance letter to Harvard. George had trouble finding the tape. He organized it in chronological order, but couldn't find it. George apologized to Brenda. \"It's okay, Dad. As long as I remember it, it's okay,\" she said."

    "content": "Scott was always curious about what he would be like in the future. Would he be rich and successful? Would he have a family? Would he die at a young age? He told his friends he wanted to see a psychic. They laughed at him and told him that psychics are just trying to take money away from customers who are too dumb to realize that they are being tricked. Scott blushed from embarrassment. Scott didn't care about what they thought. He went to see a psychic nearby. The place was dark and small. There were a lot of pretty pictures of mountains and sunsets. The psychic was a 40 year-old woman who was short and skinny. She wore a light orange dress with elegant jewelry. She had a crystal ball right in front of her. \"I'm Sharon. What do you want to find about today?\" she asked. \"I want to know about my career and family,\" he said. She rubbed the crystal ball with both of her hands and closed her eyes. \"I see money, a lot of money,\" she said. Scott was happy to hear this. \"However, I also see a divorce. You will be happy for awhile but then you will have a big argument about money,\" she said. Scott's smile turned into a frown. Scott told his parents about what the psychic told him. \"Son, you have to just live your life. Don't let her scare you,\" Scott's dad said. His dad was right."
